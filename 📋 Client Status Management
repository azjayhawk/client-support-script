📋 Client Status Management
This section explains how to pause, deactivate, or archive clients in the RadiateU system without disrupting formulas, automation, or historical records.

✅ Marking a Client as Inactive
Step 1: Update the Client Directory
Go to the Client Directory tab
Locate the client’s row
In Column D (Status), change the value to:
Inactive – to fully pause automation
Transitioning – if in the process of offboarding


✅ Clients marked as Inactive or Transitioning will be excluded from:
Monthly document generation
Master Tracker row creation (via automation)
Time Entry syncing
Client folder and doc creation



✅ Step 2: Confirm in Master Tracker
Once the client’s status is set to Inactive in the Client Directory, they will no longer appear in the Master Tracker. This is expected behavior.
What happens:
🛑 Their row is automatically excluded from the Master Tracker during sync.


✂️ This means their usage tracking, formulas, and document links are also removed from the current month’s sheet.


✅ Past archive tabs (e.g., “Master Tracker – July 2025”) will still retain their data.


✅ Their information remains in the Client Directory for future reactivation.


💡 Tip: If the client is only paused temporarily, consider setting their status to Transitioning — this still excludes them from automation but serves as a soft pause.=

🔁 Re-Activating a Client
If a client returns and needs to be included again:
Go to the Client Directory
Set Column D (Status) back to "Active"
Unhide the row in Master Tracker (if previously hidden)


Run: 🛠 Client Tools > Insert All Missing Clients into Master Tracker
✅ This will reinsert the client if they had not previously been added
🛑 If the client is already in the Master Tracker, no duplicate will be added



✅ Final Notes
Never delete old clients from the Master Tracker or Client Directory unless absolutely necessary
Status controls automation; it’s safe to leave rows in place
Hidden rows will not interfere with formulas, as long as they remain properly structured
