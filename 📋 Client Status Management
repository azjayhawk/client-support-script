📋 Client Status Management
This section explains how to deactivate, hide, or reactivate clients without disrupting your system.

✅ Marking a Client as Inactive
Step 1: Update Client Directory
Go to the Client Directory tab
Find the client’s row
Change Column D (Status) to:
"Inactive" or "Transitioning"
This ensures they are skipped by:
Monthly document generation
Folder creation
Doc link updates

Step 2: Master Tracker
If the client has already been added:
Their row remains in Master Tracker
They will be ignored during future script runs
They will not be removed from Master Tracker automatically.

Step 3: (Optional) Hide in Master Tracker
To tidy your view:
Right-click their row in Master Tracker
Choose Hide row
Optionally, leave a note in Column L:

 “Inactive as of Aug 2025”



🔁 Reactivating a Client
To bring back a paused or inactive client:
Client Directory
Change Column D back to "Active"


Master Tracker
If their row already exists: just unhide
If they were not yet added:
Run 🗂 Insert All Missing Clients into Master Tracker
They will now appear in all future rollovers and doc generation.
