ðŸ“‹ Client Status Management (Updated â€” Safe Mode System)

ðŸ”• How to Make a Client Inactive
1. Go to the **Client Directory** tab.
2. Locate the client you want to deactivate.
3. In **Column D: Status**, change the value to either:
   - **"Inactive"** â€” if they are fully offboarded.
   - **"Transitioning"** â€” if they are wrapping up but still have access.

âœ… What Happens Automatically
- The row remains in the **Master Tracker** for history and reporting.
- The client is **skipped automatically** during:
  - Monthly doc generation (`monthlyRolloverAndCreateDocsSafe`)
  - Time Entry syncing (`ensureClientInTimeEntry_`)
- You may **manually hide** their row in the Master Tracker to reduce visual clutter if desired.

ðŸ”„ How to Reactivate a Client
1. In the **Client Directory**, find the client.
2. Change **Column D: Status** back to **"Active"**.
3. Run:
   - **Client Tools > ðŸ“‹ Insert All Missing Clients to Master Tracker**
   - *(Optional)* **Client Tools > ðŸ”¤ Sort Master Tracker Aâ€“Z**

Once reactivated, the client will automatically be included again in:
- Monthly doc generation (safe mode)
- Time Entry tab sync

ðŸ§® Notes on Tracker Calculations
- **Block Hours Remaining (Column I):**
  - This value is dynamically calculated.
  - It will not go negative â€” overages are displayed in the **Uncovered Overage** column instead.
- Formulas in the Master Tracker auto-fill from Row 2 whenever a new client row is added via script.
