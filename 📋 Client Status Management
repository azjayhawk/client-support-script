ðŸ”• How to Make a Client Inactive
Go to the Client Directory tab.
Locate the client you want to deactivate.
In Column D: Status, change the value to either:
"Inactive" â€” if they are fully offboarded
"Transitioning" â€” if they are wrapping up
âœ… What Happens Automatically
The row remains in the Master Tracker for history and reporting.
The client is excluded from:
Monthly doc generation
Block hour syncing
(Optional) You can hide their row in the Master Tracker to reduce visual clutter.

ðŸ”„ How to Reactivate a Client
In the Client Directory, find the client.
In Column D: Status, change it back to "Active".
Run the menu item:
 Client Tools > âž• Add New Client (again â€” it wonâ€™t duplicate).

 This will re-enable monthly doc sync if their row is still present (rows are never removed now).

ðŸ§® Notes on Tracker Calculations
Block Hours Remaining (Column I):
This value will never go negative.
If a client uses more hours than they have available, the extra usage is shown in the Uncovered Overage column.
Formulas auto-fill from Row 2 whenever a new row is added via script.
