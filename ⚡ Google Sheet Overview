✅ Adding a New Client

- Go to Extensions > Client Tools > Add New Client

- Fill in the prompted fields (Name, Plan, Email, First/Last Name, Partner)

- The script adds the client to both:

- Client Directory with proper formatting and Active status

- Master Tracker with formatting and synced formulas

- The row is inserted at the bottom and auto-sorted A–Z

- Hyperlinking is disabled on the “Client Name” cell



✅ Marking a Client Inactive or Transitioning

- Go to the Client Directory

- Update the Status (Column D) to:

- "Inactive" – no docs will be generated; row will be hidden

- "Transitioning" – skipped during doc creation; row will be hidden

- Use Client Tools > Hide Inactive Clients to apply hiding

- Use Client Tools > Unhide All Clients to show all rows temporarily



📌 Final Notes

- Client Directory is the source of truth

- Clients must be marked Active to receive support docs

- All synced fields (Plan, Monthly Hours, Email, etc.) pull from Client Directory

- Formulas are auto-applied from Row 2 when inserting new clients

- Sorting happens automatically after each client is added

- Block Remaining can now go below zero to track overage more accurately
