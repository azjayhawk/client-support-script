🛠 Script Functions Summary
Function                           Purpose
monthlyRolloverAndCreateDocs()     Creates monthly support docs for all Active clients
monthlyRolloverAndCreateDocsSafe()     Creates monthly support docs using Safe Mode (rolling row system, prevents duplicates)
updateMasterTrackerFormulas()      Resets and reapplies formulas in F, H, I, and L–Q for all client rows
addNewClientToTracker()            Prompts for new client info & inserts into both sheets with formatting
hideInactiveAndTransitioningRows() Automatically hides clients with “Inactive” or “Transitioning” status rows
unhideAllClientRows()              Unhides all rows in Master Tracker
onOpen()                           Loads Client Tools custom menu with these utilities

⚠️ The legacy monthlyRolloverAndCreateDocs() script is deprecated and replaced by the Safe version.


✅ Adding a New Client

- Go to Client Tools ❤️ > Add Client and Sync to Master Tracker

- Fill in the prompted fields (Name, Plan, Email, First/Last Name, Partner)

- The script adds the client to both:

- Client Directory with proper formatting and Active status

- Master Tracker with formatting and synced formulas

- The row is inserted at the bottom and auto-sorted A–Z

- Hyperlinking is disabled on the “Client Name” cell



✅ Marking a Client Inactive or Transitioning

- Go to the Client Directory

- Update the Status (Column D) to:

- "Inactive" – no docs will be generated; row will be hidden if desired

- "Transitioning" – skipped during doc creation and block syncing; row will be hidden if desired

- Rows are never removed; they remain in Master Tracker but are skipped for docs and block syncing

- Use Client Tools > Hide Inactive Clients to apply hiding

- Use Client Tools > Unhide All Clients to show all rows temporarily



📌 Final Notes

- Client Directory is the source of truth

- Clients must be marked Active to receive support docs

- All synced fields (Plan, Monthly Hours, Email, etc.) pull from Client Directory

- Formulas are auto-applied from Row 2 when inserting new clients

- Sorting happens automatically after each client is added

- Block Remaining will never go below zero. Extra usage is shown in Uncovered Overage.
