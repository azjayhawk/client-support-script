âœ… Monthly Checklist
RadiateU Client Reporting Use this checklist to guide your monthly process for generating client support summaries, updating data, and delivering reports.


âœ… 1. Before Running the Script
Prep your data and check for accuracy.
Ensure DRY_RUN mode is ON: Open the script and confirm:
const DRY_RUN = true;
Sort Master Tracker: Use the ðŸ—‚ Client Tools menu â†’ Sort Master Tracker Aâ€“Z
Time Entry tab:
Copy/paste weekly time entries into appropriate columns (format: hh:mm)
Let formulas auto-calculate Total (Column M) and Decimal Hours (Column L)
Block Carryover NOT needed yet: Skip Column E for now â€” youâ€™ll fill that in after monthly rollover is complete (see Step 5).

âœ… 2. Run the Script (Dry Run Mode)
Preview output and verify everything before sending anything to clients.
Go to the Apps Script Editor (Extensions > Apps Script)
Run: monthlyRolloverAndCreateDocs()
Verify:
âœ… Only Active clients are processed (Status = Active)
âœ… Support summaries appear in each client folder
âœ… Master Tracker Column N (Support Summary Link) contains working doc links
âœ… Column T contains the correct Folder URL
âœ… Document Summary sheet shows accurate results


âœ… 3. Enter Usage & Finalize Data
Use this step to verify monthly usage and block hour activity.
In the Master Tracker:
Column F (Hours Used) is pulled from Time Entry tab
Columns Gâ€“J are auto-calculated (Overage Beyond Monthly Hours, Block Used, Remaining Block, Block Deficit Warning (hrs))
Check Column H (Block Used) is accurate based on usage vs. monthly plan
Adjust any rows manually as needed (e.g., transition clients or edge cases)


âœ… 4. Deliver Reports
You now have two delivery options:
Option A â€“ YAMM (Yet Another Mail Merge)
Use YAMM to send personalized emails with support summaries.
Use the links in Column N (Support Summary Link)
Pull email addresses from Column M
Option B â€“ WP Umbrella (Monthly Automation)
Add each clientâ€™s folder link (Column K from Client Directory) into your WP Umbrella recurring task so they can access support summaries monthly.


âœ… 5. End-of-Month Finalization
These steps should be done at the end of the current month.
Open the Master Tracker:
Copy values from Column I (Remaining Block)
Paste values only into Column E (Block Hours Available)
This locks in the carryover for next month while preserving visibility throughout the current month.
Rename the Time Entry tab (e.g., "Time Entry â€“ July 2025") and create a new blank one for the next month
Run the script again with DRY_RUN = false if you want to finalize and regenerate the docs cleanly
Delete and regenerate support documents only if needed
