✅ Checklist: Add a New Client to the System

This checklist guides you through adding a new client into the RadiateU support tracking system using built-in automation. Follow all steps in sequence to ensure accurate setup and avoid misaligned data.

⸻

🔹 Step 1: Add to the Client Directory
	1.	Open the Client Directory tab
	2.	Go to the menu:
🗂 Client Tools > Insert New Client into Directory
→ This prompts for domain and status (must be “Active” to appear in Master Tracker)
	3.	Once the row is added at the bottom, fill in these fields on that new row only:

Column	What to Enter
A	Client Name (e.g., rightstuffmedia.com)
B	Plan Type (e.g., Starter, Pro)
C	Client Email
D	Status → Must be “Active”
E–J	Optional metadata (can leave blank)
K	Leave blank — will be auto-filled

⚠️ Important: Do not manually insert or sort rows in the middle. Always add at the bottom.

⸻

🔹 Step 2: Add to the Master Tracker
	1.	Go to the Master Tracker tab
	2.	From the menu, run:
🗂 Client Tools > Insert All Missing Clients into Master Tracker

✅ This safely:
	•	Detects and appends new Active clients
	•	Preserves all formula rows and spacing
	•	Avoids data shifting or breakage

⚠️ Never insert rows into the Master Tracker manually.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Sort and Verify
	1.	From the menu, run:
🗂 Client Tools > Sort Master Tracker A–Z
	2.	Confirm the new row is working:

Column	What to Check
B	Client Name is correct
C	Plan Type pulled in via formula
D	Monthly Plan Hours populated
F	Hours Used = 0
G–I	Formulas working — no #REF!
M	Email address filled in
O–Q	First Name, Last Name, Status

🛑 Column J (“Block Deficit Warning”) is deprecated. It may be hidden but is no longer used.

⸻

🔹 Step 4: (Optional) Add Initial Block Hours

If the client is beginning with a support block:
	•	Go to their row in Master Tracker
	•	Enter the value in:

Column	Field
E	Block Hours Available

This will calculate block usage and balance correctly in formulas.

⸻

🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Create Folder and Support Doc

To generate a new folder + summary document:
	1.	In the Apps Script Editor, set:
const DRY_RUN = true; (for test mode)
	2.	Then run:
🗂 Client Tools > Run Monthly Rollover & Docs

✅ The script will:
	•	Create the Google Drive folder (if not already present)
	•	Generate a monthly support summary Google Doc
	•	Insert the Doc link in Column N of Master Tracker
	•	Insert the Folder URL in Column K of Client Directory

✅ When ready to finalize, set DRY_RUN = false and run again to overwrite with final versions.

⸻

✅ Final Sanity Check

✅ Item	Confirmed?

Client marked Active in Column D	
Appears in Master Tracker	
Master Tracker row formulas are intact	
Block Hours manually added (if applicable)	
Folder URL populated (Column K)
