📘 Instructions: Using the Client Support Tracker

✅ How to Add a New Client
Open the Tracker
 Go to the “Client Tools” menu in the sheet toolbar.
Select → ➕ Add New Client
Fill the Prompts:
Client Domain or Name (e.g., example.com)
Plan Type (e.g., Starter-0, Grow-1)
Email Address
Client Partner (if applicable)
First Name
Last Name
Done!
The client is automatically added to the Client Directory and synced to the Master Tracker.
Formatting, formulas, and data validation are applied automatically.
The Master Tracker is auto-sorted A–Z by client name.

🔕 How to Make a Client Inactive
Go to the Client Directory tab.
Locate the client you want to deactivate.
In Column D: Status, change the value to either:
"Inactive" — if they are fully offboarded
"Transitioning" — if they are wrapping up
✅ What Happens Automatically
The row remains in the Master Tracker for history and reporting.
The client is excluded from:
Monthly doc generation
Block hour syncing
(Optional) You can hide their row in the Master Tracker to reduce visual clutter.

🔄 How to Reactivate a Client
In the Client Directory, find the client.
In Column D: Status, change it back to "Active".
Run the menu item:
 Client Tools > ➕ Add New Client (again — it won’t duplicate).

 This will restore them into the Master Tracker if they were removed before, or re-enable monthly doc sync if their row is still present.

🧮 Notes on Tracker Calculations
Block Hours Remaining (Column I):
This value can go negative to indicate overage.
If a client uses more hours than they have available, the remaining value will show a negative balance.
Formulas auto-fill from Row 2 whenever a new row is added via script.
