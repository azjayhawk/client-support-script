✅ Checklist: Add a New Client to the System
Use this step-by-step checklist to onboard a new client into the RadiateU support tracking system using your automation tools.

🔹 Step 1: Add to Client Directory
Go to the Client Directory tab
Use the menu:


🗂 Client Tools > Insert New Client into Directory
This prompts you to enter the domain and status


After the new row is added at the bottom, fill in the following columns on that row only:
Column
What to Enter
A
Client Name (e.g., rightstuffmedia.com)
B
Plan Type (e.g., Starter, Pro)
C
Client Email
D
Status → Must be set to "Active"
E–J
Optional metadata (optional)
K
Leave blank – will be auto-filled by script

⚠️ Do NOT manually sort or insert into the middle of the Client Directory.

🔹 Step 2: Add to the Master Tracker
Go to the Master Tracker tab
Run the tool:
🗂 Client Tools > Insert All Missing Clients into Master Tracker
✅ This will:
Detect new Active clients in the Client Directory
Append them to the bottom of Master Tracker
Avoid formula misalignment and row shifting
⚠️ NEVER manually insert rows into Master Tracker.

🔹 Step 3: Sort and Verify
Run:
🗂 Client Tools > Sort Master Tracker A–Z
Confirm the new client’s row has correct values:
Column
What to Confirm
B
Client Name is correct
C
Plan Type is populated
D
Monthly Hours appears (VLOOKUP)
F
Hours Used is empty or zero
G–I
Formulas are present and working
M
Email is populated
O–Q
First Name, Last Name, and Status filled


🔹 Step 4: (Optional) Add Initial Block Hours
If this client is starting with unused block hours:
In their Master Tracker row
Enter the starting value in:
Column E: Block Hours Available



🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Generate Folder & Support Doc
In Apps Script, set:  const DRY_RUN = true;
Run:
🗂 Client Tools > Run Monthly Rollover & Docs


✅ This will:
Create their Drive folder (if not present)
Create a support summary Google Doc
Insert:
Doc URL into Column N (Master Tracker)
Folder URL into Column K (Client Directory)
🔄 When ready to finalize, set DRY_RUN = false and rerun.
