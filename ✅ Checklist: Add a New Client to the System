✅ Checklist: Add a New Client to the System
Use this step-by-step checklist to successfully onboard a new client into the RadiateU support tracking system.

🔹 Step 1: Add to Client Directory
Open the Client Directory tab.
Scroll to the bottom of the list (do NOT insert in the middle).
Use the Client Tools menu to add the new client (🛠 Insert New Client into Directory)
This adds a new row to the Client Directory. 
Enter the following in a new row:
Column A: Client Name (e.g., Right Stuff Media)
Column B: Plan Type (e.g., Starter, Basic, Pro)
Column C: Client Email
Column D: Status → Set to Active
Columns E–J: Leave blank unless additional metadata is required
Leave Column K (Folder URL) blank — it will be auto-filled later.
⚠️ Important: Do not sort the Client Directory immediately — let the helper sheet manage sync for now.

🔹 Step 2: Ensure Helper Sheet Updates
Open the Active Clients Sorted tab (your helper sheet).
Confirm your new client appears in the list.
This may take a few seconds via the formula.
If it doesn’t appear, check that Status = Active and there are no typos.



🔹 Step 3: Add to Master Tracker
✅ Recommended Method:
Use the 🗂 Client Tools > Insert All Missing Clients
 → This will automatically:
Detect any clients from the helper sheet not yet in the Master Tracker
Insert them alphabetically
Populate the correct formulas and structure


⚠️ Do NOT manually insert rows into the Master Tracker to avoid breaking formulas.

🔹 Step 4: Confirm Sync in Master Tracker
In the Master Tracker, verify the new client row contains:
Column Confirm
B      Client name is populated
C      Plan Type auto-filled
D      Monthly Hours filled (via VLOOKUP)
M      Email filled
O–Q    First name, Last name, Status populated
G–J    Formulas are working and not showing #REF!


🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Add Initial Block Hours
If the client is starting with a block balance:
In Master Tracker > Column E (Block Hours Available)

 → Manually enter their starting balance (e.g., 10.0)


This will feed into downstream block usage logic and summaries.



🔹 Step 6: (Optional) Trigger Folder/Doc Creation
If you’re preparing monthly documents for this new client:
Use Client Tools > Run Monthly Rollover & Docs (with DRY_RUN first)


This will:
Create a support folder
Generate a Google Doc
Link the folder URL in the Client Directory (Column K)
Insert doc link into Master Tracker (Column N)

✅ Final Checks
✅ Client appears in both Master Tracker and Helper Sheet
✅ Formulas and references are working
✅ Folder and document (if created) are linked properly
✅ Email address is correct for mail merge or automation
