✅ Checklist: Add a New Client to the System

This checklist guides you through adding a new client into the RadiateU support tracking system using built-in automation tools. Follow all steps in order to avoid data misalignment or formula breaks.

⸻

🔹 Step 1: Add to Client Directory
	1.	Go to the Client Directory tab.
	2.	Use the menu:
🗂 Client Tools > Insert New Client into Directory
→ This will prompt you to enter the client’s domain and status.
	3.	After the row is added at the bottom, fill in the following fields on that row only:

Column	What to Enter
A	Client Name (e.g., rightstuffmedia.com)
B	Plan Type (e.g., Starter, Pro)
C	Client Email
D	Status → Must be set to "Active" for automation
E–J	Optional metadata (leave blank unless needed)
K	Leave blank — this will be auto-filled later by the script



⚠️ Important: Do not manually sort the Client Directory or insert rows in the middle.
New rows should only be added at the bottom.

⸻

🔹 Step 2: Add to the Master Tracker
	1.	Go to the Master Tracker tab.
	2.	Run:
🗂 Client Tools > Insert All Missing Clients into Master Tracker
✅ This will:
	•	Append any new Active clients from the Client Directory
	•	Insert them at the bottom of the Master Tracker
	•	Preserve formulas and avoid row shifts or misalignment

⚠️ Do NOT manually insert new rows into the Master Tracker.
This may displace existing client data and break row associations.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Sort and Verify
	1.	Run:🗂 Client Tools > Sort Master Tracker A–Z
→ This keeps your list tidy without affecting data alignment.
	2.	Confirm the new client’s row is correct:

Column	What to Check
B	Client Name is correct
C	Plan Type is populated
D	Monthly Hours pulled from Plan
F	Hours Used is empty or 0
G–J	Formulas are working (no #REF!)
M	Email is populated
O–Q	First/Last Name and Status are filled in



⸻

🔹 Step 4: (Optional) Add Initial Block Hours

If this client is starting with an existing block of support time:
	•	Go to their row in Master Tracker
	•	Manually enter a starting value in:
	•	Column E: Block Hours Available

This will feed into calculations for overage, balance, and summary reporting.

⸻

🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Create Folder and Monthly Doc

To generate the folder and support summary doc:
	1.	Open Apps Script → Set:
const DRY_RUN = true; (for testing)
	2.	Then run:🗂 Client Tools > Run Monthly Rollover & Docs

This will:
	•	Create the client’s Drive folder
	•	Create a Google Doc support summary
	•	Log the doc link into Column N of Master Tracker
	•	Fill in the folder URL in Column K of Client Directory

✅ When you’re ready to finalize, set DRY_RUN = false and re-run the script to generate final documents.
