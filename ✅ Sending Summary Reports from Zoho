Sending Summary Reports from Zoho

✅ Monthly Support Summary Email Checklist

Using Zoho Mail Merge to Send RadiateU Monthly Support Reports

⸻

🗓️ Step 1: Access the RadiateU Support Email 
Log in to support@radiateu.com in Zoho Mail. 
In the right sidebar, click the plug icon ⚡ labeled “Toggle E Widget.”
From the dropdown list, select Mail Merge.

⸻

🧩 Step 2: Select the Monthly Template 
When the Mail Merge window opens, it will prompt you to choose a template. 
Select “RadiateU Monthly Support Hours Report.” 
This is the prebuilt Zoho Docs email template for monthly summaries. 
It includes merge tags such as {{Client Name}}, {{Hours Used}}, and {{Month}}.

⸻

📄 Step 3: Prepare the Monthly Data (CSV File)

Since RadiateU doesn’t use Zoho Sheets, you’ll import your data as a CSV file. 
In the New Monthly Support Tracker (Google Sheet): 
Locate the archived Master Tracker tab for the most recent month. Example: “October 2025 Master Tracker (Archive)” 
Do not use the live “Master Tracker” tab — use the archived, values-only version. 
Export this archived tab as a CSV file: File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv) 
Open the CSV in your spreadsheet editor (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) for cleanup.

⸻

🧹 Step 4: Clean and Verify the Data

Before uploading to Zoho, review the CSV carefully: 
Delete any rows for clients who: 
Did not use support hours and 
Have no remaining block hours available. 
Keep clients who: 
Used any plan or support block hours, or 
Have block hours available (even if unused). 
Verify the following fields: 
Hours Purchased This Month — confirm it includes any billed overage time or purchased support blocks. 
Double-check totals for a few clients to ensure the data exported correctly.

⸻

📤 Step 5: Upload the CSV into Zoho Mail Merge 
Return to the Zoho Mail Merge window. 
When prompted for a data source, select Upload CSV. 
Choose the cleaned CSV file you just prepared.

⸻

👀 Step 6: Preview and Validate the Merge 
Once uploaded, you’ll see a preview screen showing a sample of each personalized email. 
Use the dropdown in the preview area to review multiple recipients. 
Spot-check at least a few: 
Clients with purchased blocks 
Clients with remaining balances 
Clients with used plan hours 
If you need to tweak the wording or layout, click Edit Template to make updates.

⸻

✉️ Step 7: Send the Monthly Summaries 
After previewing and confirming all details: 
Click Send to begin the Mail Merge. 
Emails will send directly from support@radiateu.com. 
Monitor the “Sent” folder to confirm successful delivery.

⸻

🧾 Optional: Post-Send Checks Save your final CSV in the monthly documentation folder for recordkeeping. 
Note any clients who purchased new blocks for next month’s Block History tab update.

⸻

💡

 Pro Tip:

To make next month’s merge faster, keep a copy of your cleaned CSV as a reference — it helps you remember who received the prior month’s summaries and who might need manual inclusion next time.
